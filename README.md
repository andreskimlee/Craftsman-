## This is a digital advertising agency currently focusing on mobile ads. Does this interest you and why?
    Having worked closely in the marketing industry as well as previously having interacted with mobile ads (especially in video game applications, I think it really is interesting as the ads I have seen have become increasingly more interactive. They have been almost to the point where the ads mimick the real application that it is advertising. 

## Do you have any game examples you have created? (This is highly recommended)
    I have created Tic Tac Toe and Chess with Ruby in the past. Generally these games were created with object oriented principles in mind.

## Do you have an interest in games? We do have a lot of gaming clients that needs interactive ads. (Think mini games.) Does this interest you?
    Absolutely! I am a huge gamer myself and have been heavily passionate in video games ever since I was a kid. I enjoy playing video games in my freetime and is a subject of passion that I am definitely in tune with. 
## 4) Please check out our demo reel of ads we've worked on. (https://www.dropbox.com/s/of5o5oefbbgfx28/1920x1080_FB_Sizzle_2019.mp4?dl=0 ) Does these type of ads interests you? 
    Yes I am a huge fan when it comes to interactive ads and how far you can push the envelope in order to increase customer engagement.

## 5) We are a small company and are you comfortable working with a small team?
   Yes! If anything I prefer working in smaller teams where communication is more fluid. I also believe individually the ability to wear many hats in a startup are potentially possible and thus individuals can grow in both their technical and personal skills. 

## 6) How open would you be working on internal software unrelated to gaming? (Build automation tools, angular applications, restful APIs)
    I am very comfortable with developing RESTful APIS and in general web development. Thus, I would have no problem working in those fields as well. 

## 7) Attached is our engineering test to test game programming skills. These are standalone tasks and should run properly when completed. When you are finished with the test, please send back your work and include how much time you spent completing the tasks.
